A game made in JS with help of Open AI

üêç This game is a basic version of "Snake", where the player controls a snake and tries to eat food to grow longer.

This game uses the HTML5 canvas element (<canvas>) to draw the game graphics.

The snake is represented as an array of segments, and the position of each segment is updated based on the player's input.

The game loop runs every 100 milliseconds to update the game state and redraw the canvas. 

The player can control the snake's direction using the arrow keys. 

When the snake collides with the boundaries of the canvas, itself, or the food, the game ends and an alert is shown.

( This project, including the documentation above was generated with the code generation tool from the project [Genius - AI SaaS](https://github.com/Pitossomo/ai-saas) with the prompt "Make a canvas game in HTML and JS with 100 lines of code" and uses the OpenAI API. )
